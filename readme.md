# [Work in Progress] h3-py-docs

https://ajfriend.github.io/h3-py-docs

This repo hosts some initial attempts at setting up docs for `h3-py`.
Things are probably still incomplete, half-working, and not at all finalized.
The link above will also probably **not** be the final location for the docs.


code blocks in rST look like this:

```rst
.. code-block:: python

    {
        'type': 'Polygon',
        'coordinates': [outer, hole1, hole2, ...],
    }
```
